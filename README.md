Neovim Config
=============

This repository contains my configuration files for the [Neovim] text editor.

If you find yourself wondering how something works, check the message of the
commit that added it (e.g. with `git log -S`). I like to leave "future me"
notes on why things are the way they are, so my commit history often contains
links to blog posts, explainer videos, etc.

# Setup

To get it running, I essentially do this:

    $ mkdir ~/Code
    $ git clone https://github.com/gma/nvim-config.git Code/nvim-config
    $ ln -s ~/Code/nvim-config .config/nvim
